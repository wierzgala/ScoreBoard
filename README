DESCRIPTION
The ScoreBoard is a thread safe implementation of a simple score board.
It allows to create a game on the ScoreBoard, update it's score and finish it.
ScoreBoard has a method for providing a sorted list of running games and their results.

Limitations:
    - host team name and quest team name need to be provided for starting the game. Neither of it can be null
    - host team name cannot be the same as guest team name (a team cannot play a game with itself)
    - IMPORTANT: when starting a game there is no verification if the specified teams aren't part of any running games,
      hence it is possible to create many running games for the same team.

BUILD INFO
ScoreBoard was prepared to be distributed as a java library (.jar)
Project can be build using maven with standard mvn clean install

TESTING
The unit tests are implemented with JUnit.
The test coverage report is generated during build with Jacoco and can be viewed in target/site
